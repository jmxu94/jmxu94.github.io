			<p> Pix is a pixel-art RPG game. The main character is a small silly rabbit that gets lost from their family and the story progresses through their adventures as they find their way home. They meet a sly fox, accidentally step in some poop, and other rambunctious situations. </p>

		<table border = 1 >
			<tr>
				<th colspan = "2">Backpack:</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td> Carrot Sword </td>
				<td> A sword fashioned out of a carrot you found in the ground...you resist eating it. </td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td> Rutabaga Mace </td>
				<td> You don't know how to cook a rutabaga but it seems like a pretty hefty mace. </td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td> Watermelon Helment </td>
				<td> A helmet cut out of a watermelon rind....it drips on your head but seems sturdy enough.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td> Strange Red Berry </td>
				<td> You don't know what it is but it looks refreshing to eat.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td> Strange Blue Berry </td>
				<td> You don't know what it is but it looks invigorating to eat.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td> Sparkling Stone </td>
				<td> You can't eat it so you're not sure why you're still holding onto it.</td>
			</tr>

		<h2> Examining another similar website: </h2>
		<p><a href = "http://www.pixelprospector.com">Pixel Prospector</a></p>
		<p> What makes this site good is that they have a horizontal header across there page with a variety of links to different areas of the site. This makes it easy to navigate the page. </p>
		<p> What makes this site bad is that it is not very aesthetic and sometimes the links look a bit crammed.
		<p> However they have a set font, background color, and icons to aid their website. </p>
		<p> I can recognize HTML elements like: head, body, header, div, h1, h2, section, and footer. </p>
		<p> I don't recognize hgroup, span, or script. I think hgroup means a head group and is related to headings / headers. Span seems like it is used to make something extend to a length. I think script is similar to img in that it points to a javascript src like img points to an img src. </p>
