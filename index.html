	<h2> Introduction </h2>
		<p> Hello! Welcome to the hobby page for a small pixel game that I'm working on! This is just a side project that I dabble on here and there for fun. Enjoy your stay. :) </p>

	<h2> About Pix </h2>
		<p> Pix is a pixel-art RPG game. The main character is a small silly rabbit that gets lost from their family and the story progresses through their adventures as they find their way home. They meet a sly fox, accidentally step in some poop, and other rambunctious situations. </p>

	<h3> Art </h3>
		<p> The artwork for Pix is made using <strong>Asesprite</strong> on Steam and animated into gifs using <strong>Adobe CS6.</strong></p>
		<p> While some artwork is on this welcome page, you can check out all the art here: <a href = "artwork.html">Artwork</a></p>

	<h3> Music </h3>
		<p> The music for Pix is made using <strong>Fl Studio 12</strong> and <strong>Garageband.</strong></p>
		<p> Some of the music for Pix is located here: <a href = "music.html">Music</a></p>

	<h3> Gameplay </h3>
		<p> The gameplay follows traditional jRPGs in that characters move following WASD or arrow keys. Action and menu inputs have not yet been considered. The game is made using <strong>GameMaker: Studio.</strong></p>
