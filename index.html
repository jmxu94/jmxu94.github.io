			<p class="small-font"><em>[scroll down]</em></p>
			<p>Pix is a pixel-art adventure RPG game. You, the main character, play as a small rabbit that gets lost from their family. You wake up in a grassy field. Your goal is to find your way home.</p>
			<p>The story progresses through meeting some other fellow woodland creatures (friend or foe), fighting by utilizing the resources around you, and figuring out how and why you got lost in the first place.</p>

			<tr>
				<td> Carrot Sword </td>
				<td> A sword fashioned out of a carrot you found in the ground...you resist eating it. </td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td> Rutabaga Mace </td>
				<td> You don't know how to cook a rutabaga but it seems like a pretty hefty mace. </td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td> Watermelon Helment </td>
				<td> A helmet cut out of a watermelon rind....it drips on your head but seems sturdy enough.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td> Strange Red Berry </td>
				<td> You don't know what it is but it looks refreshing to eat.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td> Strange Blue Berry </td>
				<td> You don't know what it is but it looks invigorating to eat.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td> Sparkling Stone </td>
				<td> You can't eat it so you're not sure why you're still holding onto it.</td>

		<h2> Examining another similar website: </h2>
		<p><a href = "http://www.pixelprospector.com">Pixel Prospector</a></p>
		<p> What makes this site good is that they have a horizontal header across there page with a variety of links to different areas of the site. This makes it easy to navigate the page. </p>
		<p> What makes this site bad is that it is not very aesthetic and sometimes the links look a bit crammed.
		<p> However they have a set font, background color, and icons to aid their website. </p>
		<p> I can recognize HTML elements like: head, body, header, div, h1, h2, section, and footer. </p>
		<p> I don't recognize hgroup, span, or script. I think hgroup means a head group and is related to headings / headers. Span seems like it is used to make something extend to a length. I think script is similar to img in that it points to a javascript src like img points to an img src. </p>
